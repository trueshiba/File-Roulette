# File-Roulette
Uses random walks to display any number of random files from your computer. Just a cool little utility program I've made.


## Testing:
Run the file in whatever program you use. I found that IDLE works the best and it will 
also run in vscode just fine. It should be fine in all others as well but I wasn't able to test it in 
everything so technically I don't know. If you are using a Mac for some reason and your root folder
isn’t “C:/” please modify it to whatever directory you want random files from. It is clearly marked 
where you should change this within the code.
